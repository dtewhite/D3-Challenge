          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Care Coverage and Poverty</h2>
          <p>What impact does poverty have on health care coverage? This project uses state data from the census
            to try to answer that questions. The above graph shows the percent of people in every state that have
            health insurance and the percent of people in every state that live below the poverty line.</p>

          <p>It is not too surprising that there appears to be a positive linear relationship between how much 
            poverty is in each state and how many people do not have health insurance. You can imagine that someone
            living in poverty will may not have a job that provides health insurance and may not be able to afford
            private coverage either.</p>
